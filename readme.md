This iframe generator takes just two parameters and generates a quick iframe while also previewing the result. I made this to help me deploy interactives and graphics to NBC Bay Area.

##Angular Version
I've refactored this app with Angular.js as a learning exercise. There are some new features, too, like live-updating of the iframe code and preview dimensions. [Give it a try here](http://development.iframe-generator.divshot.io/)
